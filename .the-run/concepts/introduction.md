## What is Flask?
Flask is web application mini framework written in python. Its a micro-framwork in that it does not include feature like [ORM](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1279613/what-is-an-orm-how-does-it-work-and-how-should-i-use-one) (Object Relational Manager) It  however, has alot of other cool features like url routing and template engines. 
## Why Flask
I'm struggling with an opening statement for this subsection so, I'm just gonna jump right in. 
Flask is a very powerful Framework considering what it brings on the table that other Tech stacks don't. 
Alot of big websites like [Netflix](https://netflix.com) uses Flask for their backend infrustructure to serve their API's and more. 
Speaking of cool, the coolest feature I've come across(So far ) is Flash messages. 

## Getting started with Flask 

To get started with flask, you dont really need a trip around the moon and back. The very basic knowledged of Python, HTML and some CSS is all  you need to roll.
